* C++
  * Stable
* [Zig](https://ziglang.org)
  * Experimental support
  * The current state of the Zig toolchain is not stable, and may be updated at any time.
  * Used an experimental [C API for Defold](https://github.com/defold/defold/blob/dev/engine/extension/src/dmsdk/extension/extension.h)
* C#
  * Experimental support
  * Based on DotNet 9 with AOT compilation
  * Generated from an experimental [C API for Defold](https://github.com/defold/defold/blob/dev/engine/extension/src/dmsdk/extension/extension.h)
